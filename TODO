TODO file

1. fix the input_checking.R file (especially checks on model_loss and 
inlier_loss)

2. Generate the test data and the corresponding tests with testthat 

3. How do we avoid problems with the model_matrix the formula and the intercept
if we generate the model-matrix 

4. Fix that the model in the ransac body 
(not in any of the subfunctions) still uses the design matrix as the data
and not in the formula. So the formula that uses the design matrix should 
be created in check_inputs (and not in ransac_once) so it can be used here 
as well
